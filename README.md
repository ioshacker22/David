👋 About Me
I'm a Computer Programming student at Seneca Polytechnic with a focus on systems programming, backend development, and building things from the ground up.
This repository contains the source code for my personal website, designed as a game-inspired space to showcase my projects, experience, and how I think about software.

🎮 About This Site
The website is intentionally built with vanilla technologies:

✅ No frameworks
✅ No abstractions hiding the fundamentals
✅ Clean, readable, and honest codebase

The goal was to create something memorable while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
