David Adebambo
I’m a Computer Programming student at Seneca Polytechnic with a focus on systems programming, backend development, and building things from the ground up.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, designed as an game-inspired space to showcase my projects, experience, and how I think about software.

About this site
The website is intentionally built with vanilla technologies.

No frameworks.
No abstractions hiding the fundamentals.

The goal was to create something memorable while keeping the codebase clean, readable, and honest.

Built with
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Styling and interactions are written by hand to maintain full control over layout, behavior, and performance.

Features
Mario-inspired UI

Smooth scrolling navigation

Animated elements 

Project highlights with direct GitHub links

Experience timeline with tabbed navigation

Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

Projects highlighted
Some of the work showcased on the site includes:

2FA Authentication App
A two-factor authentication system with TOTP, QR enrollment, and secure token validation.

VPN application (in development)

Why this exists
This site isn’t meant to be flashy for the sake of it.

It exists to:

show how I structure projects

demonstrate my comfort with fundamentals

reflect my curiosity and intentional design choices
